# demarcate.js

**Version 2.0**

In short:
	
> demarcate.js allows you to edit an HTML document "in place", using the CSS styles of your page.  Users
are not required to know markdown, instead they just click on a DOM element and start typing! When finished
you can access the edited markdown through javascript.

**VERSION 2.0 will result in a couple of API changes which are detailed below.**

demarcate.js is an in-place Markdown Editor under development by 
[William Hart](http://www.williamhart.info) for [http://to-textr.com/](http://to-textr.com/) 
and released under an MIT license.  As of version 2.0, a complete redesign was undertaken with
the following goals:
	
1. Remove `jQuery` dependency
2. Remove `showdown.js` dependency
3. Support mobile browsers
4. Provide a richer, more "desktop" like UI
5. Improve modularity of the parser so additional markup languages can be supported (RST?!)

Demarcate has one optional dependency - [keys.js](http://bitwalker.github.io/keys.js/).

## LIMITATIONS

Currently not all Markdown syntax is supported.  In particular:

- Mathjax equations in the HTML halt rendering. [[#8](https://github.com/will-hart/demarcate.js/issues/8)].

## UPGRADING TO 2.0 FROM 1.x.x

A number of API changes were made.  The most important of these is that now demarcate expects all DOM 
elements received in function arguments to be native DOM elements, not jQuery ones.  In some cases
CSS selectors can now be passed instead of jQuery elements:
	
	// no longer supported:
	demarcate.enable($("#any_element"));
	
	// instead use
	demarcate.enable(document.getElementById("any_element"));
	
	// or 
	demarcate.enable($("#any_element").get(0));
	

jQuery helper functions no longer work: 
	
	// the following jQuery style function calls are deprecated and have been removed
	$("#any_element").demarcate();
	$("#any_element").disable_demarcate();
	
The `isActive` function call is no longer relevant and has been removed. `isEnabled` still returns `true` if 
the editor is enabled and false otherwise.

To better reflect the modularity of decoding, (i.e. as other formats could be supported in the future)
	
	// The following is deprecated and will be removed in the future.
	demarcate.demarcate()
	
	// instead use:
	demarcate.parse()

Events have also been renamed to reflect javascript code standards:
	
	demarcate_editor_closed >> demarcateEditorClosed
    demarcate_editor_enabled >> demarcateEditorEnabled

The editor object in events can be accessed as follows:
	
	document.addEventListener('demarcateEditorEnabled', function(e) {
		var editor = e.detail.editor;
		
		// do something with the editor
	});
	
Or using jQuery:
	
	$(window).on('demarcateEditorEnabled', '#demarcate', function (e) {
		var editor = e.detail.editor;
		
		// do something with the editor
	});


## USAGE

** NOTE THIS SECTION STILL RELATES TO 1.1.4 - UPDATES TO 2.0 WILL FOLLOW**

**For developers, API documentation is available:**    
- [v1.1.4 - stable](http://www.williamhart.info/static/demarcate/docs/)    
- [develop branch](http://will-hart.github.com/demarcate.js/docs) 

The `editor.html` file shows a sample implementation of demarcate. It can be seen
running at [http://will-hart.github.com/demarcate.js/](http://will-hart.github.com/demarcate.js/).  

In short, two files need to be included in order to use demarcate - one js and 
one CSS file.  Also make sure you have the required images in and `img` directory.

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/demarcate.css">
    <script src="js/demarcate.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

> **NOTE** the minified version of demarcate.js includes all js dependencies

Next you need to add a script tag to the bottom of your page.  Use a jquery
selector to pick an DOM tree section to act as the in-place editor.  This is 
done as follows:

    $('#container').enable_demarcate();

Alternative javascript syntax is available which performs the same task:

    demarcate.enable($("#container"));

Every valid object (specified in the `editor_whitelist` array) within the 
`#container` DOM element will have the in place editing behaviour attached to 
it (i.e. click to edit).

To get the markdown from the elements, you can use the `demarcate()` function:

    // use this for any element
    $("#any_element").demarcate();
        
    // or
    var markdown = demarcate.demarcate($("#any_element"));
    
    // or for the Markdown from the current editor
    var markdown = demarcate.demarcate();
    

Demarcate provides a number of events that can be subscribed to, enabling your 
application to respond to editor actions.  In particular the 
`demarcate_editor_closed` event which is fired whenever an editor is successfully
closed and the changes are saved.  You can listen to this event using `bind` 
and automatically push the changes up to your server using ajax.  For instance:

    $(document).bind('demarcate_editor_closed', function(e, elem) {
        var md = demarcate.demarcate();
        $.post('http://my/api/url/', md});
    });
